## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need a C compiler installed on your system. The most common one is [GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

* **For Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux:**
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    ```
* **For macOS:**
    Install Command Line Tools by running:
    ```sh
    xcode-select --install
    ```
* **For Windows:**
    You can use [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) or the C++ development workload in Visual Studio.

### Compilation and Execution

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/C-Programming.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/C-Programming.git)
    cd C-Programming
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a specific program's directory:**
    ```sh
    cd path/to/your/program
    ```
3.  **Compile the C file:**
    Replace `program_name.c` with the name of the file you want to compile.
    ```sh
    gcc program_name.c -o program_name
    ```
4.  **Run the executable:**
    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        ./program_name
        ```
    * On Windows:
        ```sh
        program_name.exe
        ```
